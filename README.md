# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
I used Visual Basic for Application  (VBA) to analyze a stocks data with a goal to choose a profitable stock for investment. I used prescarpped dataset of 12 stocks and analyzied their performance (Total Volume and Return) over two years (2017 1nd 2018). The client is especially interested to know if DQ is a good staock to invest in.

The results are obtained by refactoring a code and the results were compared with the original code. 

## Results
### Stock performance:
As we can see from the pictures below:
- Year 2017 was a good year over all as compared to 2018. 
- DQ was the best performing stock in 2017 but it didn't do so well in 2018. 
- ENPH has consistenty performed well over two years. 
In nutshell, investing in ENPH instead of DQ will b a good decision.

### Refactoring Performance:



## Summary: 
In this project the results are obtained by refactoing the code and then comparing the results with the original code. 
### Advantages of refactoring code: 
- It improves the design of the code.
- It makes the code run faster
- it helps debugging easy
- it improves the understanding of the code/programming.

### Disdvantages of refactoring code:
- It can be time consuming
- It doesn't provide additional insight into data
- It doesn't improve the features of the output. 
- it is not necessary if the program is already running efficiently. 
-
### Pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
