# UCB-VBA-Project

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary: 
In this project the results are obtained by refactoing the code and then comparing the results with the original code. 
### Advantages of refactoring code: 
- It improves the design of the code.
- It makes the code run faster
- it helps debugging easy
- it improves the understanding of the code/programming.

### Disdvantages of refactoring code:
- It can be time consuming
- It doesn't provide additional insight into data
- It doesn't improve the features of the output. 
- it is not necessary if the program is already running efficiently.
